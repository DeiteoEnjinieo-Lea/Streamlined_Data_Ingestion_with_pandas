# Streamlined_Data_Ingestion_with_pandas
### Data Ingestion with Pandas Exercises

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises focused on data ingestion with pandas. The exercises cover a range of topics, including:

- Reading data from different file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
- Handling missing data
- Filtering, sorting, and transforming data
- Joining and merging data from different sources

The exercises are designed to be completed in a Jupyter notebook, although they can also be completed in any other Python environment that supports pandas.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/deiteoenjinieo-lea/streamlined_data_ingestion_with_pandas.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the root directory and open the `importing_data_from_databases1.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook environment.

## Completing the Exercises

The `importing_data_from_databases1.ipynb` file contains a series of cells with prompts and code blocks to complete. Follow the prompts and complete the code blocks to complete the exercises.

If you get stuck, there are hints and solutions provided in separate cells after each exercise. Try to complete the exercises without looking at the hints or solutions first, and only refer to them if you get stuck.
